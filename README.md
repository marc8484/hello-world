# hello-world
hello-world is a repository created from the Activities Guide from GitHub directly. This is one of my first project walkthroughs with GitHub. Enjoy! :)

Procedures to use this are fairly simple. 
1. Download File
2. Extract the ZIP or RAR with a program to unzip
3. Go grab a coffee
4. Begin by opening the folder fg\as.
5. Confused?!
6. Start at Step 1. again
7. End

Thank you.
